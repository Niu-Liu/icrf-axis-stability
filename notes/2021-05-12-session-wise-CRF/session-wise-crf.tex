%\section{Introduction}     \label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%Figure~? presents the relative orientations of yearly VLBI solutions, i.e, 
%based on VLBI observations truncated at a certain year, with respective to
%the ICRF3 $S/X$-band catalog.
%One can see an abrupt change in the orientation angles in the year of 2002-2003.
%A possible cause to this discrepancy could be improper modeling of the position of
%the station GILCREEK.
%In order to understand the possible cause, I ran several solutions.
%The configurations of these solutions are listed below.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Solution A: identical setup and parameterization to opa2021a;
%	\item Solution B: identical setup and parameterization to opa2021a, expect that 
%	CILCREEK was removed from the ;
%
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Session-wise CRF}    \label{sec:computations}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\subsection{Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The source positions derived from observations in each sessions solely were
drawn from the \texttt{.lso} file available at the Paris Observatory Geodetic VLBI Center 
\footnote{\url{http://ivsopar.obspm.fr/radiosources/opa2021r.lso}}, which contains estimate of 
source positions from session-wise independent VLBI solution, and we used 
these position to form the session-wise celestial reference frame.
Then I estimated the rotation and glide parameters of these session-wise CRFs with respect to 
the ICRF3 based on the subset of sources common to the ICRF3 defining source ensemble
(I also considered using all common sources to the ICRF3 but the results are not presented here).
Source whose position difference between the session-wise CRF and ICRF3 $S/X$ is greater than 10~mas 
or is three times greater than their formal uncertainty was removed.
Only sessions with more than six sources common to the ICRF3 defining source ensemble were considered, 
which rejected most sessions before the 1990
Figure~\ref{fig:sess-wise-pmt} presents the estimates of rotation and glide parameters.
I also computed the root-mean-square of every 100 data points weighted by their formal uncertainties 
as the scatter of the parameters, as indicated by the red dashed line therein.
The rotation parameters are generally stable at the level of 100-200~$\mathrm{\mu as}$ since 1995, except a small jump in $\epsilon_x$ and $\epsilon_y$ at about 2017.
A similar jump can also be seen in $g_z$.
So one may say that the ICRF3 stability is satisfied among 1990 (or 1979)-2021.

%\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Our computation explained the formation of the enigmatic
% \MgI\,12\,$\mu$m emission features.
% They arise through population depletion by line photon losses and
% population replenishment from the ionic reservoir through highly
% excited levels.
% A Rydberg-channel replenishment flow is realized by
% collisionally-dominated population diffusion via ladder-wise departure
% divergence (see Fig.~\ref{fig:waterfalls} in
% Sect.~\ref{sec:computations}).
%% Note the tilde.  Fig. \ref would generate too much end-of-sentence space
