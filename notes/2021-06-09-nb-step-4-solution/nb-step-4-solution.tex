\section{Introduction}     \label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this note, I study how the number of steps used to generate the global time series affects the assessment of the ICRF3 axis stability.
I ran separately a 4-, 8-, 10-, and 20-step solution. 
Then on the one hand, I estimated the apparent proper motion for extragalactic sources and fitted the global spin of the CRF axis (Sect.~\ref{sec:spin}).
On the other hand, I computed the annual mean positions of sources to construct the yearly CRF and estimated their relative rotation and glide wrt. the ICRF3 S/X-band frame (Sect.~\ref{sec:yearly-crf}).
Some things that may lead to confusions are pointed out here.
In some plots, I used $\omega_x$, $\omega_y$, and $\omega_z$, while in others I used $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and $\omega_3$.
In fact, they refer to the same things.
It is the same for the $g$ parameter.
Another thing is that I used words ``rotation'' and ``glide'' in the title of some figures, but they are not always referred to the same things.
Sometimes, the rotation and glide parameters were estimated from the proper motion data, whilst they can also be estimated from the positional offset.
I did not spell it out clearly when I made these plots, but you may find the exact information from the captions. 
They can also be told from the unit.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Proper motion and derived spin}     \label{sec:spin}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

First, I considered only the subset of the ICRF3 defining sources, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:spin-def}. 
For different number of steps, the spin and glide are fully consistent with the error bar. 
The rotation and glide axis is about 80 deg and 40 deg away from the GC. 
I think that we cannot make any firm conclusion on relationship between the estimated spin and glide vectors and the GA effect.

Second, I considered all the sources with a determinable apparent proper motion and used the bootstrap sampling technique to estimate the mean spin and glide. 
For a given sample size $N$, I randomly picked $N$ sources from the sample to form a subset and estimated the glide and spin based on this subset. 
This procedure was repeated 1000 times.
The mean value and standard deviation of the spin and glide parameters were used as the estimations of mean spin and glide and their uncertainties.
The sample size varied from 100 to 1000 with a step of 100.
The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:spin-glide-all}.
The noticeable difference occurs to $\omega_z$ (or $\omega_3$, they are the same thing.) and $g_z$ (or $g_3$), which become insignificant when the number of step increases.

I took the weighted mean values of glide and rotation parameters in Fig.~\ref{fig:spin-glide-all} as the mean spin and glide.
The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:spin-all}. 
We can found that the spin around the Z-axis ($\omega_3$ or $\omega_z$) decreases if using more than four steps. 
Similarly, the glide parameters ($g_1$ and $g_3$, or $g_x$ and $g_z$) also decreases. 
The glide axis is far from the GC direction, however, the rotation axis direction is very close to that of GC.

\section{Orientation of yearly CRF} \label{sec:yearly-crf}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Figures~\ref{fig:rotation-plot} and \ref{fig:glide-plot} present the relative rotation and glide parameters of yearly CRFs with respective to the ICRF3 $S/X$-band catalog.
Only the ICRF3 defining sources were used.
I found that the influence of different choices of the number of steps on estimations of these parameters is rather tiny.

%\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Our computation explained the formation of the enigmatic
% \MgI\,12\,$\mu$m emission features.
% They arise through population depletion by line photon losses and
% population replenishment from the ionic reservoir through highly
% excited levels.
% A Rydberg-channel replenishment flow is realized by
% collisionally-dominated population diffusion via ladder-wise departure
% divergence (see Fig.~\ref{fig:waterfalls} in
% Sect.~\ref{sec:computations}).
